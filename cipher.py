"""
Alice has taken up cryptography course. She recently learnt the interesting topic

of transposition ciphers. In transposition ciphers, the cipher is keyed by a word or

phrase not containing any repeated letters. The purpose of the key is to order the

columns, with column 1 being under the lexicographically smallest key letter and

so on. The plaintext is written horizontally, in rows, padded to fill the matrix if need

be(with abcdef....). The ciphertext* is read out by columns, starting with the

column whose key letter is the lowest. Help her convert

Note: Lexicographical ordering is same as the roman alphabetical ordering i.e. A

is smallest and B is greater than A and Z is the greatest.

Input format:

First line contains the key, a single word with all uppercase alphabets without any

white spaces in between.

Second line contains an integer N

N lines follow, each containing a single plaintext, a word with all uppercase

alphabets without any white spaces in between.

Output format:

Output is N lines each containing the ciphertext for the corresponding plaintext,

with all uppercase roman alphabets.

Constraints:

1<=N<=1000

1<=Key length<=10

1<=Plaintext length<=1000

n a b c d Â­> last row is having only 1 character, so we pad it with abcd.

As you read the columns vertically, based on the key, you will arrive at the

ciphertext: TYRCRNHOYOAANFUPICKOREOD
